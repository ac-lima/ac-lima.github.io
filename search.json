    "title": "Understanding Glacier Melt with Drones: The Case of Tapado Glacier, Chile",
    "section": "",
    "text": "My master’s thesis explores how supraglacial ponds and ice cliffs influence the melting patterns of Tapado Glacier in the semiarid Andes of Chile. These features, found on the debris-covered surface of the glacier, play a crucial role in how the glacier loses mass. Using a mix of historical aerial imagery, satellite data, and drone-based surveys, I built an inventory of these features from 1956 to 2023. The goal was to understand their distribution, how they form, and—most importantly—how they accelerate ice melt in specific areas.\n\n\n\nLocation of Tapado Complex and its landforms. The three main landforms that will be discussed in the thesis are 1) Tapado Complex-, 2) debris-covered glacier (upper and lower debris-covered glacier) pinpointing ice cliffs in Area 1 and Area 2, 3) Area 1 representing UAV survey thermokarst depression from 2019 to 2020, and 4) Area 2 representing cliffed area surveyed in 2022 and 2023\n\n\nThe results showed that even though ponds and cliffs occupy a relatively small surface area, they have an outsized impact on glacier thinning. For instance, ice cliffs alone can increase melt rates by more than six times compared to surrounding areas.\n\n\n\nSurface elevation changes related to supraglacial pond and ice cliff formation for each 5 m within 30 m radius. Left graph shows surface lowering for each analyzed year, middle graph for each analyzed period and right graph according the presence or absence of ice cliffs for each analyzed period\n\n\nI also found that these features tend to form in areas with low surface slope and slow ice movement—insights that help explain why certain parts of the glacier are thinning faster than others.\n\n\n\nFigure on the top shows the location of supraglacial ponds by cliff presence, year and area based on surface velocity and slope gradient of debris-covered glacier on Tapado Complex.\n\n\nImportantly, the use of drone technology (UAVs) proved to be a game-changer, offering high-resolution 3D models that captured subtle changes missed by satellite imagery.\n\n\n\nM3C2 yearly distances in meters from dense cloud pair 2022-2023 for cliff area 2. On the left is the dense cloud point represented in RGB\n\n\nThis research adds to our understanding of how climate change is affecting high mountain water sources. Tapado Glacier provides meltwater to over 230,000 people downstream, making it a critical resource in a region already facing water scarcity. By highlighting the importance of supraglacial features and the power of UAV-based remote sensing, this thesis offers valuable tools for future glacier monitoring and water resource planning in the Andes and beyond.\n\n\n\nTapado Glacier supraglacial ponds and ice cliffs inventory from 1955 to 2023\n\n\n\nContact\nHave questions?

    "text": "Our research investigated the relationship between air temperature and land surface temperature (LST) in São Paulo, Brazil, focusing on how urbanization and seasonal variations affect temperature patterns across the city. We used remote sensing data to quantify the urban heat island effect and found substantial temperature differences between urban and rural areas. Specifically, urban regions experienced temperatures approximately 5.8 to 11.5 °C warmer than rural areas during spring–summer and 4.4 to 8.5 °C warmer during autumn–winter, clearly showing how urban development significantly influences local climate.\n\n\n\nLand Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification of Sao Paulo city on the right. Thermal mapping of LST of Sao Paulo during summer on center and during winter on the left.\n\n\nMore important, this study demonstrates that remote sensing is a highly effective, affordable, and practical tool for monitoring urban climate conditions. By providing precise enough spatial temperature data, our findings can directly inform urban planning strategies and environmental policies. Ultimately, this research highlights the importance of integrating remote sensing technology to better manage and mitigate urban heat island effects in growing cities that don’t have a network of weather stations.\n\n\n\nComparison between Air Temperature and Land Surface Temperature during winter (left) and summer (right) seasons.\n\n\n\nContact\nHave questions?
