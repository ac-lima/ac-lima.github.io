Our research investigated the relationship between air temperature and land surface temperature (LST) in São Paulo, Brazil, focusing on how urbanization and seasonal variations affect temperature patterns across the city. We used remote sensing data to quantify the urban heat island effect and found substantial temperature differences between urban and rural areas. Specifically, urban regions experienced temperatures approximately 5.8 to 11.5 °C warmer than rural areas during spring–summer and 4.4 to 8.5 °C warmer during autumn–winter, clearly showing how urban development significantly influences local climate.

More important, this study demonstrates that remote sensing is a highly effective, affordable, and practical tool for monitoring urban climate conditions. By providing precise enough spatial temperature data, our findings can directly inform urban planning strategies and environmental policies. Ultimately, this research highlights the importance of integrating remote sensing technology to better manage and mitigate urban heat island effects in growing cities that don't have a network of weather stations.
