    <strong>GeoBridge</strong> is a collaborative initiative that connects researchers and students from diverse academic backgrounds united by a shared interest in <strong>geographical information systems (GIS)</strong> and <strong>remote sensing (RS)</strong>. The platform forsters  knowledge exchange in  techniques applied to landscape dynamics in a changing world and aims to support interdisciplinary collaboration, research visibility, and skill development at the interface of the <em>biosphere</em>, <em>geosphere</em>, and <em>cryosphere</em>.
